% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
Mean sum of squares clustering  (MSSC) is one formulation of the clustering problem. The solution is able to group like data in so called cluster. These are useful in a variety of applications, from data science to machine learning. The difficulty is computing the solution to the MSSC formulation effectively and efficiently. 

The following report follows the implementation of a DC algorithm for solving MSSC problems. Specifically, it provides an introduction to clustering of data, K-means clustering, and implementing a DCA formulation from~\cite{an_minimum_2009} to compare with.
