\section{Discussion}

In table \ref{tab:exresults} the averages of 200 cycles with random seeds 0-199 are shown and a number of interesting results can be gleamed. The first is that it would appear that in both cases a heuristic based initialization improved the accuracy and time to completing of each of DCA on each of the test datasets. I believe this has to do with preventing ill-conditioned starting centroids such as have two place too close to each other and/or away from the rest of the entities. The second is that it would appear my implementation of the DCA from \cite{an_minimum_2009} appears to contain some mistake as my results do not agree with \cite{an_minimum_2009} on the same dataset VOTE.
